\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider a game in which each agent faces a knapsack problem.
 Each item's price is known, but each item's value is a 
\emph on
random variable
\emph default
 with a known distribution.
 The realized value is only revealed after all players have formed their
 knapsacks.
 We might imagine, for example, a number of agents preparing to survive
 an unknown stretch of wilderness.
 If a given agent chooses
\emph on
 bearspray
\emph default
 for her knapsack, and then goes out into a world in which there are many
 bears, then the bearspray takes on a high value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Premise of the Game
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More formally, each player, 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in N$
\end_inset

 , has some budget 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

, with which to buy items for their knapsacks.
 Each item 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in M$
\end_inset

, has some price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j},$
\end_inset

and draws value from a known distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 We say that a given agent 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 wins if (1) the value of her knapsack is weakly greater than the value
 of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

's knapsack, for all 
\begin_inset Formula $j\neq i$
\end_inset

, and (2) there exists an agent 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 such that the value of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $j's$
\end_inset

 knapsack is strictly less than the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $i's$
\end_inset

 knapsack.
 If one agent wins, she receives utility of 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

.
 All agents who lose pay 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

.
 If multiple agents (say 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{w})$
\end_inset

 tie to win (a 
\emph on
split win
\emph default
), each winning agent receives 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{{n-n_{w}}}{n_{w}}$
\end_inset

.
 If all agents tie, each receives 0.
 We consider variations where players choose items simultaneously or sequentiall
y.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This game can be used to model a wide variety of competitive and resource
 constrained settings.
 In particular, this game is a generalization of fantasy sports, where players
 form a team (knapsack) with the goal of choosing players (items) who will
 score the highest number of points.

Two Player Variance Independence

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we consider the simplest specification of this problem.
 Let there be 2 players and 2 items.
 Denote the two items 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

, and further assume that the items have identical means 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[X_{1}\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[X_{2}\right]=\mu$
\end_inset

 and symmetric distributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition

\begin_layout Plain Layout

[Symmetric Distributions]
\end_layout

\end_inset

Let a probability distribution be symmetric if there exists a value 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

 such that its probability density function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 exhibits the following property:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(x_{0}-\delta\right)=f\left(x_{0}+\delta\right)\ \forall\delta\in\mathbb{R}
\]

\end_inset

Further, the median and mean of a symmetric distribution are both equal
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 All symmetric distributions have no skewness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Symmetric distributions provide a good starting point for this analysis,
 as it abstracts away from skewness and include the most common distributions
 used in academic research (uniform, normal, Student's 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, etc.) Focusing on these distributions lets us analyze the importance of
 variance (and all even moments) on each player's decision processes.
 The tractability resulting from assuming 2 players gives our first important
 result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "thm:1"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 be two continuous, independent random variables with symmetric probability
 density functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 and expectation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[X_{1}\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[X_{2}\right]=\mu$
\end_inset

.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left(X_{1}>X_{2}\right)=\mathbb{P}\left(X_{2}>X_{1}\right)=\nicefrac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
WLOG, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1-2}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 denote the probability density function of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}-X_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1-2}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{1-2}\left(z\right)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{1}\left(z+x\right)f_{2}\left(x\right)dz.
\]

\end_inset

Now, I assert that 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1-2}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 is symmetric about zero.
 To see this, use symmetry of 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{1-2}\left(z\right)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{1}\left(-z-x\right)f_{2}\left(-x\right)dz
\]

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y=-x$
\end_inset

.
 Substituting this, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{1-2}\left(z\right)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{1}\left(-z+y\right)f_{2}\left(y\right)dy.
\]

\end_inset

This is simply equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1-2}\left(-z\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1-2}\left(z\right)=f_{1-2}\left(-z\right)\ \forall z$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1-2}$
\end_inset

 is symmetric about zero.
 The mass above and below zero must be equal.
 As a result, we have:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{P}\left(X_{1}>X_{2}\right)=\int_{0}^{\infty}f_{1-2}\left(x\right)dx=\nicefrac{1}{2}
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{P}\left(X_{2}>X_{1}\right)=\int_{-\infty}^{0}f_{1-2}\left(x\right)dx=\nicefrac{1}{2},
\]

\end_inset

which proves our result
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 be two discrete, independent random variables with symmetric probability
 distribution functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}\left(\cdot\right)$
\end_inset

 and expectation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[X_{1}\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[X_{2}\right]=\mu$
\end_inset

.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left(X_{1}>X_{2}\right)=\mathbb{P}\left(X_{2}>X_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

.

\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 exceeding 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

, these probabilities do not necessarily equal 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 due to the fact that the probability of ties is not necessarily zero.

 provide a powerful result for this baseline setup.
 The only relevant statistic for examining the setup described above is
 expected value.
 With two players, and two items with symmetric distributions, both players
 always prefer the item with the higher expected value.
 If both items have the same expected value, then both players are indifferent
 between the two items.

\begin_layout Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1},\dots,X_{n}$
\end_inset

 be symmetric random variables with means 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{1},\dots,\mu_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}$
\end_inset

 is symmetric with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
In the proof of Theorem 1, set 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}=-X_{i}$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 (Note that if 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

 is symmetric, then so too is 
\begin_inset Formula $-X_{i}$
\end_inset

.) The random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}-X_{2}=X_{1}+X_{i}$
\end_inset

 is therefore symmetric and has mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{1}+\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Repeat this process for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i=2,\dots,n$
\end_inset

 to obtain the result.

 items with symmetric distributions but potentially different means.
 For any allocation of the

 items such that the knapsacks of both players have the same mean, higher
 moments do not affect the probability of winning.

In other words, any two combinations of symmetric random variables with
 the same mean have the same probability of exceeding the other.

\begin_layout Standard
The theory in this section provides several directions to consider.
 The first is the potential importance of variance in settings in which
 there are more than 2 players.
 This gives rise to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mean-Variance Tradeoff,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which we discuss in the next section.
 Second, we can generate useful insights on the importance of skew using
 asymmetric distributions, which we discuss in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mean-Variance Tradeoff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous section, we established that in a two player setting in
 which items are independent and have symmetric distributions, the only
 relevant statistic is expected value.
 Players care only about the expected value of the items, and no other propertie
s of the distribution, including variance.
 However, the case in which (1) there are more than two players, and (2)
 items have potentially different means, variance can become an important
 consideration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see this, consider the following illustrative example.
 There are three items, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}\sim U\left[-1,1\right]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}\sim U\left[-2,2\right]$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{3}\sim U\left[-100,100\right]$
\end_inset

.
 It is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[X_{1}\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[X_{2}\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[X_{3}\right]=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{V}\left[X_{3}\right]>\mathbb{V}\left[X_{2}\right]>\mathbb{V}\left[X_{1}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The probability that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{3}$
\end_inset

 is the largest value is bounded below by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{P}\left(X_{3}\geq\max\left\{ X_{1},X_{2}\right\} \right)\geq\mathbb{P}\left(X_{3}\geq2\right)=0.49.
\]

\end_inset

In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{3}$
\end_inset

 wins at least 49% of the time.
 This is due to the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{3}$
\end_inset

 has a high variance, so it can have realizations that are much higher than
 are possible for 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, with more than 2 players, variance becomes an important consideration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 plots the probability of winning for the above example in which we set
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{3}\sim U\left[-a,a\right]$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1,\dots,100$
\end_inset

.
 For small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 clearly performs the best; however, this performance quickly drops off.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $a\geq20$
\end_inset

, the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 winning is almost indistinguishable from the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 winning.
 The importance of variance is clearly evident from this figure.

We quantify the importance of variance by asking the question: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How much excess variance does one require to be indifferent between that
 item and an item with an excess mean of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and how does this change with the number of players?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 To answer this question, we begin with a setup in which there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 players and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 items (each player gets exactly 1 item).
 All items are independent of each other and come from the same distribution
 family (i.e., all distributions are uniform).
 
\begin_inset Formula $N-2$
\end_inset

 of the items are identically distributed with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 1 item has mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu+x$
\end_inset

 and variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high mean item
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The remaining item has mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}+s^{2}$
\end_inset

 (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high variance item
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 We denote 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excess mean,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{2}$
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

excess variance.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We estimate, via simulations, a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 that makes agents indifferent between the high mean item and the high variance
 item.
 We can think of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 that maps the excess mean and the number of players to the excess variance.
 Using this approach, we can characterize the function 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(x,N\right)$
\end_inset

 for various distributions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider two specifications in this simulation.
 The first features 
\begin_inset Formula $N-2$
\end_inset

 items 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ X_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N-2}\overset{iid}{\sim}U\left[-1,1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The high mean item is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{N-1}\sim U\left[-1+x,1+x\right]$
\end_inset

, and the high variance item is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{N}\sim U\left[-a,a\right]$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that we can also express the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{N}$
\end_inset

 in terms of excess variance, 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, as: 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{N}\sim U\left[-\sqrt{3s^{2}+1},\sqrt{3s^{2}+1}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 We opt for the simpler specification of 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left[-a,a\right]$
\end_inset

, but the specification in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 highlights the relationship between a change in the bounds of the uniform
 distribution and variance.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The second specification features 
\begin_inset Formula $N-2$
\end_inset

 items 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ X_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N-2}\overset{iid}{\sim}N\left(0,1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The high mean item is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{N-1}\sim N\left(x,1\right)$
\end_inset

, and the high variance item is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{N}\sim N\left(0,1+s\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Without loss of generality, these two specifications completely characterize
 the mean-variance tradeoff for all possible parametrizations of the uniform
 and normal distributions in which 
\begin_inset Formula $N-2$
\end_inset

 items are iid.

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $N-2$
\end_inset

 items that are distributed 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left[-1,1\right]$

.
 In principle, for the normal specification, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 can take on any positive value, since normal distributions feature an unbounded
 support, so no value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 reduces to a two player setup.
 Nevertheless, the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 approaches infinity as 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 increases.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 using the two specifications considered above.
 There seems to be an exponential relationship between excess mean and excess
 variance, although the variance becomes flatter with more players.
 For the three-player uniform specification, an excess mean of 0.2 requires
 an excess variance of 0.7, but an excess mean of 1 requires an excess variance
 of over 60.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is a decline in the excess variance from 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.95$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

.
 We do not expect the true relationship between mean and variance to exhibit
 such non-monotonicities.
 The decline shown in the figure is likely a result of our simulation results.
 To solve for the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, we rely on update rules that sequentially narrow the window of search
 based on which distribution has a greater probability of winning.
 As a result, an anomalous result can lead to the algorithm narrowing the
 region when in fact it should not.
 We hypothesize that this is the cause of the decline.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean-variance tradeoff becomes increasingly flat as the number of baseline
 players increases.
 This is due to the fact that excess mean is increasingly less valuable
 as the number of players increase.
 This can be seen most clearly in the uniform specification.
 As the number of players increase, the maximum value of the baseline players'
 items approaches the upper bound of the distribution (in this case, 1).
 Thus, a marginal increase in the excess mean is likely to have less of
 an effect on the win probability.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, if the excess mean is 1, there is still only a 50% probability
 of the high mean item having a greater value.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Excess variance, on the other hand, is much less dependent on the number
 of baseline players.
 By increasing the range (i.e., the support of the distribution), the high
 variance item has a higher probability of achieving a value that is above
 the support of any of the other items, which results in a victory with
 certainty.

Excess mean becomes increasingly less valuable as the number of players
 increases, while excess variance is relatively unaffected.
 Thus, for a given excess mean 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, the excess variance required to compensate for this is a decreasing function
 in the number of baseline players.
 This result is being driven in the decreasing marginal value of excess
 mean, rather than the marginal value of excess variance.

We can see the relationship between the mean-variance tradeoff and the number
 of baseline players in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This plots the ratio of the excess mean, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, to the excess variance, 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{2}$
\end_inset

, as a function of the number of baseline players.
 We examine the uniform and normal specifications with excess means of 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.5$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

.
 We see that this ratio is concave in the number of baseline players.
 A lower excess mean results in a more concave function, but this is purely
 a result of the exponential nature of the mean-variance relationship documented
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 There is a flattening relationship due to the fact that, as mentioned above,
 there is diminishing marginal returns to increased excess mean.
 As a result, for a given excess mean, as the number of players increases,
 less excess variance is required to compensate for this.
 This gives the increasing relationship shown.
 The concavity of this function indicates the excess variance required decreases
 at a decreasing rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, we see that the normal distribution has a function that is consistently
 greater than the uniform distribution.
 Indeed, both normal specifications (with excess means 0.5 and 1) are both
 strictly greater than both uniform specifications.
 This indicates that for a given 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, the uniform distribution requires a higher excess variance to compensate
 for this.
 We believe this is due primarily to the bounded support of the uniform
 distribution.
 Increasing the variance of a uniform distribution reduces the mass on any
 given event but increases the support.
 Increasing the variance of a normal distribution does not expand the support,
 but increases the probability of extreme values.
 As a result, higher excess variance is more valuable in the normal specificatio
n than in the uniform specification, and, as such, less excess variance
 is required to compensate for a given excess mean.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In theory, this mean-variance tradeoff could be examined for any distribution
 that accepts at least two parameters, including both skewed and discrete
 distributions.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Two parameters are required, as we need to be able to vary the mean and
 variance independently of each other.
 Therefore, we need at least two degrees of freedom.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, there are issues with both skewed and discrete distributions.
 For skewed distributions, altering the parametrizations not only affects
 the mean and variance, but also the skew.
 Skew, as we will see in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:4"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, is an important consideration.
 As a result, such an analysis with skewed distributions is likely to confound
 the tradeoff between mean and variance with variation in skew as well.
 We tried this analysis for the gamma distribution, but, in our simulations,
 we could only obtain equivalent values for very small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 (less than 0.3; 6% of the baseline mean).
 This was due to changes in the skew of the distribution.
 As we changed our parametrizations to have the same mean but increasing
 variance, the distribution became more skewed to the right, shifting most
 of the mass to the left.
 This made the resulting distribution less desirable.
 For a fixed mean, the variance comoved with skew, and, because of this,
 we were not able to solve for an indifference point in the mean-variance
 tradeoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For discrete distributions, the issue was one of computational imperfection.
 Because almost all discrete distributions require at least one integer-valued
 parameter (binomial, hypergeometric, etc.), we cannot have a continuous
 mapping of these parametrizations to mean and variance.
 As a result, there are often only one or few parametrizations that result
 in a given mean.
 Solving for an indifference between mean and variance (which requires iterating
 over various parametrizations until convergence) is infeasible as a result.

 Suppose the expected values and the variances of each item's value are

The analysis so far has focused entirely on symmetric distributions, which
 have no skew by definition.
 In this section, we briefly analyze the effect of skewness on the desirability
 of items.
 Note that, for the reasons discussed above, it is difficult to perform
 a tradeoff analysis between mean, variance, and skewness due to the covariation
 in them when there are fewer than 3 parameters (as is the case with almost
 all common distributions).
 As a result, the analysis in this section relies on general findings, rather
 than a quantitative evaluation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 illustrates two distributions with different skewness, but the same mean
 and variance.
 The black line is the pdf of a gamma distribution with shape of 1 and scale
 of 2.
 The blue line is a pdf of a normal distribution with mean 2 and standard
 deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The gamma distribution has a skew of 2, while the normal distribution has
 no skew.
 While these distributions come from different families and exhibit different
 supports, this serves as a reasonable comparison to establish the importance
 skewness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our simulations, the item that is normally distributed has a value that
 exceeds the item that is gamma distributed 56.17% of the time.
 Positive skewness, therefore, does not seem to be a desirable property.
 This is fairly intuitive; because positive skew shifts the mass to the
 left of the distribution, the median is less than the mean (while, in a
 distribution with no skewness, the mean and median are the same).
 This means that the median of the gamma distribution is less than the median
 of the normal distribution.
 Indeed, the gamma distribution has a realization below its mean (2) 63.2%
 of the time, compared to 50% of the time for the normal distribution.
 Because of this, the normal distribution has a significant advantage over
 the gamma distribution.

\begin_layout Section
Cycles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In choosing items sequentially, it is important to understand whether cycles
 can exist in item comparisons.
 Specifically, do there exist three items 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{3}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 beats 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 more than 50% of the time, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 beats 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{3}$
\end_inset

 more than 50% of the time, and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{3}$
\end_inset

 beats 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 more than 50% of the time? Then, a player's preferences can be expressed
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}\succ X_{2}\succ X_{3}\succ X_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This intransitivity of preferences (a so-called Condorcet cycle) is generally
 an undesirable property, and is typically a ruled out by assumption in
 decision theory research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the adversarial knapsacks problem, cycles are possible.
 This is due to the fact that, even with independent random variables, the
 distribution of the difference of two random variables is given (in part)
 by the product of their probability density functions.
 As a result, Condorcet cycles can occur due to the interaction between
 these distribution functions.
 An example of a possible cycle is given by the following three items:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{c}
X_{1}=0\\
X_{2}=\begin{cases}
1 & w.p.\ 0.51\\
-1.04 & w.p.\ 0.49
\end{cases}\\
X_{3}=\begin{cases}
-1 & w.p.\ 0.52\\
1.08 & w.p.\ 0.48
\end{cases}
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

All three items have zero mean.
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 beats 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 51% of the time, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 beats 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{3}$
\end_inset

 52% of the time, and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{3}$
\end_inset

 beats 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0.48+\left(0.49\times0.52\right)\right)=73.48\%$
\end_inset

 of the time.
 Thus, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}\succ X_{1}\succ X_{3}\succ X_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples of Condorcet cycles that are analytically tractable tend to be
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unnatural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that they are ad-hoc specifications of distributions.
 We are interested in whether there exists a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cycle, i.e., a cycle that features items whose values follow common distributions
 (uniform, normal, binomial, etc.).
 To do so, we simulate pairwise comparisons between 22 parametrizations
 of 13 distributions, and search for cycles among them.
 We place the restriction that all distributions have the same expected
 value to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.
 We set this value to 10.

 presents the parametrizations and distributions considered, as well as
 their empirical variance and skewness.
 There is a wide range of variance and skewnesses considered.
 Variance ranges from 1 to nearly 300, while skewness ranges from -0.18 to
 nearly 7.
 These distributions provide a starting point for understanding whether
 Condorcet cycles can arise

\begin_layout Standard
As with the example devised above, the margins in the cycle are fairly small.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 beats 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 51% of the time.
 Since our simulations estimate win probabilities with error,

\end_inset

 the determination of what constitutes a

\end_inset

significant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 win probability is essential.
 To calibrate this choice of the margin required for a preference to be
 considered significant, we rely on the theory in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Since we know for symmetric distributions, only expected values, all uniform,
 normal, and discrete uniform specifications should perform identically.
 Of the 21 pairs of these 7 distributions (3 uniform, 1 normal, 3 discrete
 uniform), the maximum difference between in winning probabilities is 0.64%.
 Thus, any margin that is greater than 0.64 should be significant at the
 5% level.
 We thus set the critical margin to 0.64.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using 0.64 as the critical margin, we observe a cycle between distributions
 1, 18, and 6.
 Distribution 1 beats 18 by a margin of 0.7%, 18 beats 6 by 2.04%, and 6 beats
 1 by 1%.
 Similar to the example above, the margins are fairly small.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These margins are close to the critical margin of 0.64, but our simulations
 do not allow for greater power in this test.
\end_layout

 Thus, out of the 231 pairs of distributions considered, there is a cycle
 between the 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left[0,20\right]$

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Weibull\left[10,10.51\right]$

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These cycles are interesting phenomena.
 Not only do they violate a key axiom in standard preferences, but also
 form intersting game-theoretic applications.
 The presence of cycles essentially affects whether the first mover has
 an advantage.
 If cycles did not exist, players in a sequential game would simply choose
 the item that performed the best against other items.
 Since there are no cycles, there is a globally-preferred option, and player
 2 would only be able to choose the next-best option.
 However, if there were cycles in all items, the first-mover would be guaranteed
 to lose on average.
 For any item player 1 chose, player 2 would be able to choose another item
 that performed relatively better.
 In the case in which there are cycles with some items, the first mover
 would never choose one of those items, for the same reason.
 This essentially reduces the option set available to the first mover.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Utility Estimation and Minimax
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an extension to our previous simulations, we also consider simulated
 games where players form knapsacks simultaneously, and may unknowingly
 choose the same set of items.
 To analyze the effects of item type (that is, the distributions that items
 draw from), number of players, and number of items, we estimate utility
 for a player in every possible matchup of knapsacks, and then use minimax
 to search for the optimal strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Utility Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate the utility of a given knapsack in a matchup against an any
 number of other knapsacks we take 10,000 draws from each knapsack's distributio
n (in the case where knapsacks are composed of more than one item, each
 knapsack draw is the sum of all item draws), where each draw represents
 a round of play.
 We then find the utility for each round, and take the average.
 Recall that if 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{w}$
\end_inset

players split win, they each receive utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{{n-n_{w}}}{n_{w}}$
\end_inset

.
 The maximum achievable utility for a player in a given match is 
\begin_inset Formula $\{0,\frac{{1}}{n-1},\frac{{2}}{n-2},\ldots,(n-1)\}$
\end_inset

, where in the first case all players tied, in the second case 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

 players tie and one player loses, and in the last case one player wins
 all.

\begin_layout Standard
This approach to utility estimation is intuitive, but requires many draws
 from each distribution for an accurate estimation.
 Furthermore, because there are 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{n}$
\end_inset

(recall: 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 knapsacks, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 players) possible matches, simulating games with many players and many
 items the computational costs are exponential.
 Unfortunately, this has limited the number of simulations we have been
 able to conduct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Minimax
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once utility has been estimated for a given number of players and items,
 we use the minimax approach to solve for an optimal strategy for a given
 player.
 In cases where minimax returns a mixed strategy, we can treat it as a new
 mixture distribution.
 Our implementation of minimax uses the linear programming approach presented
 in lecture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Symmetric Distributions and Equal Means
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consistent with our two player variance independence result, when there
 are only two players, minimax advises one choose any given strategy (that
 is, minimax as we have implemented it will put all probability on whichever
 knapsack is first).
 However, when we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $n>2$
\end_inset

, the minimax strategy places probability on a few items with high variance,
 though we have been unable to devise functions to estimate how many items
 minimax randomizes over..

Symmetric Distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With symmetric distributions and heterogenous expectations, the minimax
 solution typically randomizes over a combination of items with high variance
 and high mean.
 However, we have again been able to determine any consistent rule.

While we have had difficulty characterizing minimax strategies, it does
 at least appear that the results are not quite uniform.

Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we have presented here represents only a small part of what might be
 investigated in the adversarial knapsack game.
 In the future, it may be interesting to investigate the following.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Risk Attitudes and Tie Games
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a game with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 players and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 possible knapsacks there are 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{n}$
\end_inset

possible matches.
 Of these, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{{m!}}{(m-n)!}$
\end_inset

 matches where each player can play a unique knapsack.
 In the remaining games (
\begin_inset Formula $m^{n}-\frac{{m!}}{(m-n)!}$
\end_inset

) at least two players tie (the most obvious cases being those where all
 players play the same item - there are 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 of these).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{{m}}{n}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, the ratio of matches where all players can play unique knapsacks to number
 of matches where at least some players will tie decreases.
 In the future, it may be interesting to investigate what kinds of players
 prefer games with higher likelihood of a tie (where a low payout is more
 likely) to games with low likelihoods of a tie (but where winning results
 in a large payout).

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Number of Items, Item Types, and Players
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we have been able to generalize some results to scenarios with 
\begin_inset Formula $n`$
\end_inset

players, it would of course be ideal to further investigate the effect of
 increasing the number of items and players on the optimal strategy.
 It may be further interesting to consider knapsacks where some number of
 items need to be of a given type.
