# Adversarial Knapsack
Project for CS-590.2, Computational Microeconomics, at Duke University, Fall 2018.

## Premise

There are $n$ players (indexed by $i$), each with budget $b_i$. There are $m$ items (indexed by $j$) with price $p_j$ and value $v_j$, which is a random variable with a known distribution.

The player who forms the knapsack with the highest value wins. Players only care about winning: utility of 1 for winning, 0 for a tie, and -1 for losing. Players may form knapsacks simultaneously or sequentially, and values are only revealed after formation.
