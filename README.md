# Adversarial Knapsacks
Project for CS-590.2, Computational Microeconomics, at Duke University, Fall 2018.

## Premise

There are *n* players (indexed by *i*), each with budget *b<sub>i</sub>*. There are *m* items (indexed by *j*) with price *p<sub>j</sub>* and value *v<sub>j</sub>*, which is a random variable with a known distribution.

The player who forms the knapsack with the highest value wins. Players only care about winning. They receive utility of *-1* for losing and *n-1* for winning (split among winners in the event of a tie). If all players tie, each receives *0*. Players may form knapsacks simultaneously or sequentially, and values are only revealed after formation.
